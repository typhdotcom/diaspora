# Archived Files

This directory contains superseded implementations that are kept for reference.

## Files

### HolonomyProof.lean
Pedagogical triangle example with 3 axioms. Superseded by HolonomyLagrangeProof.lean (0 axioms) which proves the general n-cycle case.

### NoPrivilegedFrame.lean
Gauge structure fundamentals with 5 axioms. These ideas are now proven constructively in GaugeTheoreticHolonomy.lean.

### MathematicalStructure.lean
Topology and measure theory infrastructure with 10 axioms. Not needed by current proofs which work directly from Mathlib.

## Status

These files are kept for historical reference but are not maintained. The current codebase achieves the same results with zero axioms by working constructively from first principles.
